BITWISE AND OF NUMBERS RANGE  =>

Given a range [m, n] where 0 <= m <= n <= 2147483647, return the bitwise AND of all numbers in this range, inclusive.

Example 1:
		Input: [5,7]
		Output: 4

Example 2:
		Input: [0,1]
		Output: 0

Approach 1:
   Traverse from m to n , and perform bitwise (&) of all data...   
   But this is not optimised code, 
   Time Complexity here is O(n)

Approach 2:
  Optimised in code...
